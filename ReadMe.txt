This is the total project of a test platform which gives different wave form to the meterial and receives the feed back.

The main difference between it and a normal facility is that it could work in a quitely high frequency(10^9Hz).

FPGA and VHDl folders are the code for fpga.

stm32 is the code for MCU(stm32).

SCH is the schematic design of the circuit.

doc is the Ofiicial file for the chips.

Ptool and PC are the Pc api and code for it.
